After the Yoshikazu incident, the Qing Dynasty undertook a series of reforms called Shinko Shrine, but at the same time the revolutionary movements overturning the Qing Dynasty were rapidly progressing. In May 1911, when the Qing Dynasty issued a railway state-owned ordinance and exaggeratedly oppressed the opposition movement against it, it became clear that Kodo Shinzaki was only a measure to prolong the Manchukui rule indeed, and the revolutionary tone increased further. As the riot that started in Sichuan gets fierce, when the new army of Wucho who was ordered to repress on 10 October (Year of Yin) stands up on the revolution side, the uprising expands at a stretch and the uprising of 14 provinces Declared independence. The foundation of the Republic of China was declared in January 12, Emperor Qing Dynasty abdicated in February, the first republic in China history (ROC) was established. However, soon the real power was deprived by the warlord Yu Seika, and many challenges still remained in realizing the real Chinese revolutionary aims aimed at the revolutionaryists such as Sun Yat-sen (for example, Miyawadaism).

The depression began in America, but since the United States had overwhelming economic power then, the impacts of other capitalist countries were serious. Especially in Germany where economic reconstruction was promoted by introducing American capital, companies and banks went bankrupted due to capital shortage due to the rise in US capital. However, the Soviet Union of the socialist country was implementing the five-year plan at that time and rarely was affected by the depression of the capitalist country. Each country that was in depression launched various countermeasures, but in addition to Italy, which was a fascist regime immediately after the war, fascist forces emerged in Germany and Japan, and they decided to push the way for war.
